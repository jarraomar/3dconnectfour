# Connect 4

## Projective Objective

In this project, we aim to model the classic game of Connect 4 using Forge.

Connect 4 is a two-player connection game in which players alternately drop colored discs into a vertically suspended grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. The original grid is usually 7x6 but we will be modeling a 5x4 grid, a Player 1 and Player 2 with turn-based play, and the win condition of aligning 4 discs. 


## Our Regional Variation

Stacking: Stack "+2" or "+4" cards, passing penalty onwards.
Zeroes and Sevens: "0" to rotate hands, "7" to swap hands.
Custom Wild Cards: Use blank wilds for house-made rules.
No bluffing on Wild Draw Four: Disallows challenge rule.
